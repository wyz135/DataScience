Based on Melbourne Uni Statistical Mechanics Assignment 3

This python code simulates the evolution of capital where a fix amount is deposited at the fixed rate,
while the growth of the capital has an annual average growth rate of a, and subjected to market fluctuation D.

For negative growth rates, it is found that the growth of capital stabalizes, and its stationary probability
distribution function can be solved by the underlying Fokker-planck equation, which agrees with the resulting
density histogram plot.
